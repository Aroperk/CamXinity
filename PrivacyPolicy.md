Privacy Policy

### Access and Permissions
Cam Xinity is a camera app with visual effects. The purpose of this app (Cam Xinity) is to add variuos visual effects on the output of your device camera and display them on your device screen. If you choose to, you are also able to take screenshots and screen recordings of what you see on your device screen (while using the app). All permissions are strictly used only for this basic functionality.

To function correctly, the application (Cam Xinity) requires access to the camera of your android device. If you want to record a video, the application (Cam Xinity) will also need permission to record your screen, audio (microphone access) and to give notifications about screen recording. I want to make it clear that screen recording can only be initiated and stopped by you and with your knowledge.

### Information Collection and Use
The application (Cam Xinity) does not collect, store or share any personally identifiable information. It also does not record anything without your permission, intention and knowledge. All pictures and videos (taken using this application) are only stored in the main gallery of your android device. What you decide to do with your pictures and videos is based on your own personal preference and responsibility.

If you installed this application from Google Play, then Google Play does collect some personal data. Please see the privacy policy for Google Play Services here: https://policies.google.com/privacy
